# Back to the big bang

(From the Postcards from the Terascale) series.)

Particle accelerators allow physicists to look farther and farther
back in time, to revisit the high energies of the early universe after 
the big bang. Do the four forces we observe today - gravity, 
the electromagnetic force, and the weak and strong forces - converge
to a single unified force at ultrahigh energy?
Particle collisions may provide the first evidence for such 
unification of forces.
