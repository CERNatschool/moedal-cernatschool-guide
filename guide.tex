% Abstract
\begin{abstract}
The MoEDAL experiment (Monopoles and Exotics Detector at the LHC)
is the seventh major experiment at CERN's Large Hadron Collider.
%It is housed in the underground cavern at Interaction Point (IP8) -- next
%to the LHCb experiment as shown in Figure 1.
%
It is designed to probe the LHC's particle collisions
for signs of Paul Dirac's hypothesised magnetic monopole,
as well as other highly ionising signs of new physics that
the other LHC experiments cannot easily look for.
%
The Institute for Research in Schools (IRIS) is a full member of 
the MoEDAL Collaboration, and students associated with IRIS
have access data from the MoEDAL experiment and are able to contribute
to the MoEDAL Collaboration's research programme.
%
This document aims to provide a brief guide to the history, theory,
and physics of the MoEDAL experiment so that IRIS students and teachers
can take full advantage of these opportunities.
